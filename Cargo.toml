# oracle = "0.6" # Commented out until we confirm OCI lib availability or strategy. 
# Using a feature flag or conditional compilation would be better but let's assume we can build it.
# Actually, let's include it but we might face build errors in this environment if OCI isn't here.
# For now, I will omit 'oracle' from the direct list and mock the DB interaction in this environment 
# if I can't compile it, OR I will assume the user has the environment set up. 
# given I am in a "cli" environment, I might break the build if I add it.
# I will add it but be prepared to handle build failures.
